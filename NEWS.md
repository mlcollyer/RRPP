# CHANGES IN RRPP 2.0.1

### NEW FEATURES
+ Updated all QR decompositions that forced dense-matrix methods when not needed.
+ Added functions to remove design matrix parameter redundancies without using QR decomposition.

### BUG FIXES
+ Fixed issues with model matrices for new data in `predict.lm.rrpp` and made the code more universal for different model formulae.
+ Fixed standard error method for intercepts in `.coef.lm.rrpp`.
+ Fixed some circularity issues with `.lm.rrpp` associated with covariance matrices (causing non-adjusted matrices).
+ Fixed some issues with multiple functions that misused the logical `subTest` output from `lm.rrpp.ws`.
+ Fixed issues with `anova.multi.model` and `logL` related to missing `Pcov` when GLS models are used.

# CHANGES IN RRPP 2.0.0

### NEW FEATURES
* Added arguments for restricted resampling to `lm.rrpp` and `predict.lm.rrpp`, and permutation of full model residuals (with restrictions) to `lm.rrpp`.
* Added new function, `measurement.error`.
* Added new function, `lm.rrpp.ws`.
* Added `verbose` arguments to most analytical functions to reduce dense results.
* Added utility functions (`getANOVAStats`, `getPermInfo`, `getTerms`, and `getModels`) to accommodate `verbose` function choices, plus allow users to easily extract objects as output.
* Added new function, `ICCstats`, for calculating ICC statistics for `lm.rrpp` fits.
* Added S3 generic functions for `measurement.error`, but also added a plot utility function, `focusMEonSubjects`, which builds off of `plot.measurement.error`, to focus attention on specific plot details.
* Added function, `interSubVar`, a utility function to use along with `measurement.error`,
to visualize how variation between replicate measures, within subjects, can affect inter-subject variation.

### BUG FIXES
*  Fixed SSCP issue in `summary.lm.rrpp` that produces matrices of 0s.  The issue was inherent to `lm.rrpp`, from erroneous assignment of models, only for output (not for mechanics).
* Attempted fix of `predict.lm.rrpp` for QR-truncated design matrices. 
* Fixed illogical `print.progess` conditions in `pairwise`.
* Fixed potential problem with reliance on `Matrix::qrQ`, using rather, `Matrix::qr.Q`.

* Fixed missing data issue in `lm.rrpp` (passed onto `lm`).
* Fixed some `as.matrix` names dropping in support code.

* Added a step to coerce single-column matrices to vectors in `rrpp.data.frame` to prevent downstream issues.

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.6.0 (Minor Release)

### NEW FEATURES
* `ordinate` function.
* `summary.ordinate` and `plot.ordinate` S3 functions
* `add.tree` function (for plotting with `plot.ordinate`)

### OTHER CHANGES

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.5.2 (Patch Release)

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed issue with GLS estimation of coefficients in pairwise (used GLS residuals instead of
transformed residuals, by mistake).

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.5.1 (Patch Release)

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed data.frame error in lm.rrpp for within-formula transformations (like log or poly).
* Arranged effect.type argument options in lm.rrpp to match anova.lm.rrpp).

### NEW FEATURES
* `prep.lda` A new function to generate arguments for `lda` in the `MASS` library.

### OTHER CHANGES

* No longer a `verbose` option with `manova.update`.  The function was optimized to provide verbose output without having to slow down computation time.

### BUG FIXES

------
