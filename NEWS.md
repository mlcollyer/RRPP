# CHANGES IN RRPP 1.0.0 (Major Release)

### NEW FEATURES
* Computation of sums of squares in `lm.rrpp` using `Matrix` package and sparse matrix calculations.  This speeds up computation time and requires far less memory allocation.
* The `lm.rrpp` function now has a an argument, `turbo`, which can suppress calculating coefficients in random permutations, if unneeded, which can speed up analysis of large data sets.
* More options for parallel processing.
* New function, `convert2ggplot`, for coercing `RRPP` plots into ggplot objects.

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.6.2 (Patch Release)

### NEW FEATURES
* Added option to add abscissa to `plot.predict.lm.rrpp`.
* Added Box-Cox transformation to `effect.size`.
* Added option to flip axes in `plot.ordinate`.
* Updated `predict.lm.rrpp` so that functions in formulae are permissible.

### OTHER CHANGES 
* Adapted `summary.pairwise` to perform degree transformations rather than `print.summary.pairwise`, so that objects saved are the same as objects printed.
* Removed error trap from pairwise for n = 1 groups.

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed class check on `model.comparison`.
* Fixed `manova.update` pc dimension issue (output)
* Fixed `xlim` and `ylim` to be adjustable in `plot.ordinate`.
* Added transform logical output to ordinate.
* Fixed intercept only model issue in lm.rrpp.

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.6.1 (Patch Release)

### NEW FEATURES
### OTHER CHANGES
### BUG FIXES
* Refined `manova.update` to have more efficient code and better notes.
* Fixed a bug in `summary.manova.lm.rrpp` that mixed up rows and columns of a matrix of random stats.
* Fixed a bug that eliminated row names for `lm.rrpp` data when converting a vector of data to a matrix.
* Added a step to coerce single-column matrices to vectors in `rrpp.data.frame` to prevent downstream issues.
* Made it possible to use `trajectory.analysis` with univariate response data, omitting vector correlations output.

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.6.0 (Minor Release)

### NEW FEATURES
* `ordinate` function.
* `summary.ordinate` and `plot.ordinate` S3 functions
* `add.tree` function (for plotting with `plot.ordinate`)

### OTHER CHANGES
* Updated support functions for `lm.rrpp` to provide better flexibility for different formulas.  
* Changed `$LM$data` in `lm.rrpp` to be a model frame rather than a data frame, consistent with `$model` from `lm`.

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed issue with transformation of dependent variable -- e.g., log(y) -- in formula for lm.rrpp. The bug was a failure to transform the variable(s).

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.5.2 (Patch Release)

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed issue with GLS estimation of coefficients in pairwise (used GLS residuals instead of
transformed residuals, by mistake).

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.5.1 (Patch Release)

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed data.frame error in lm.rrpp for within-formula transformations (like log or poly).
* Arranged effect.type argument options in lm.rrpp to match anova.lm.rrpp).

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.5.0 (Minor Release)

### NEW FEATURES
* `prep.lda` A new function to generate arguments for `lda` in the `MASS` library.

### OTHER CHANGES
* `classify` deprecated (in favor of `prep.lda`)
* Changed the ouput structure for lm.rrpp objects.  Either OLS or GLS statistics are returned, not both.  There is no longer differentiation between GLS and weighted stats, as weighted stats are GLS estimated stats.  The difference is obvious with the inclusion of weights or Cov matrix.
* No longer a `verbose` option with `manova.update`.  The function was optimized to provide verbose output without having to slow down computation time.

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed some issues with linear model weights and offset, throughout many functions.
* Sweeping changes to be CRAN 4.0 compliant



# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.4.3 (Patch Release)

### NEW FEATURES

### OTHER CHANGES

### BUG FIXES 
* Fixed a parallel processing issue with internal function, `SS.iter` (produced incorrect RSS).
* Fixed multi-model anova TSS issue.
* Fixed an issue with the centering of trajectories in `trajectoty.analysis`.
* Fixed an issue for calculating fitted values for GLS in the `lm.rrpp` function.


------

# CHANGES IN RRPP 0.4.2 (Patch Release)

### NEW FEATURES

### OTHER CHANGES
* Added `tol` and `pc.no` arguments to `model.comparison` (were fixed before) so that users have more control of the analysis.

### BUG FIXES 
* Tweaked logL tolerance calculation to be consistent with `prcomp`.
* Tweaked support code for `lm.rrpp` to work better with missing data frames.
* Fixed absolute eigenvalue issue with Cov.proj.
* Added forgotten code from last update to fix non-full rank design matrices.
* Fixed `trajectory.analysis` traj.list issue, to not use grep for sorting trajectories.  (Now lexical ordering of interactions is used.)
* Changed `det` to `determinant` in all needing functions, to use modulus for near-singular matrices
* Fixed bug in `plot.lm.rrpp` (code lines out of order)

------

* Updated `procD.lm` to better work with data in the global environment rather than a data frame. 

------

    (was returning 0).
* Fixed some issues with the aov.multimodel subfunction of `anova.lm.rrpp`, related to GLS permutations and intercept only models.  
* Added random SS output to aov.multimodel subfunction of `anova.lm.rrpp`, so that it can be called by other functions/packages.
    
------

# CHANGES IN RRPP VERSION 0.2.0 (Minor release)

### NEW FEATURES

* `pairwise function`: allows pairwise comparison of means or slopes for a `lm.rrpp fit`.
* A vignette for using RRPP, which is the same as Appendix S2 in Collyer and Adams 
    (2008). RRPP: An R package for fitting linear models to high-dimensional data using 
    residual randomization. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.  (submitted)

### OTHER CHANGES

* Added multi-model inference capability to `anova.lm.rrpp`
    
### BUG FIXES
