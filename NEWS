BUG FIXES 
    o Fixed the logL function within model.comparisons for GLS determinants (was returning 0).
    o Fixed some issues with the aov.multimodel subfunction of anova.lm.rrpp, related to GLS permutations and intercept only models.  
    o Added random SS output to aov.multimodel subfunction of anova.lm.rrpp, so that it can be called by other functions/packages.
