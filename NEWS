    o Added model.comparison function.
    o Added classify function.
OTHER CHANGES
    o Added a pairwise variance comparison for the pairwise function.
BUG FIXES 
    o Fixed some issues with univariate data for classify.
    o Fixed some issues with univariate data for pairwise.
    o Fixed the logL function within model.comparisons for GLS determinants (was returning 0).
    o Fixed some issues with the aov.multimodel subfunction of anova.lm.rrpp, related to GLS permutations and intercept only models.  
    o Added random SS output to aov.multimodel subfunction of anova.lm.rrpp, so that it can be called by other functions/packages.
    
    
CHANGES IN RRPP VERSION 0.2.0

NEW FEATURES
    o pairwise function: allows pairwise comparison of means or slopes for a lm.rrpp fit.
    o A vignette for using RRPP, which is the same as Appendix S2 in Collyer and Adams (2008). RRPP: An R package for fitting linear models to high-dimensional data using residual randomization. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.  (submitted)

OTHER CHANGES
    o Added multi-model inference capabaility to anova.lm.rrpp
    
BUG FIXES 
    o Fixed issue for coef.lm.rrpp tests when type II or type III SS is chosen, to make sure that appropriate coefficients are used.
