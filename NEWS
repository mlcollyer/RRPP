RRPP VERSION 0.4.0.9000 (Development)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN RRPP VERSION 0.4.0 (Minor release)

NEW FEATURES
    o manova.update function
    o trajectory.analysis function
    o reveal.model.designs function
    o New vignette for ANOVA versus MANOVA in RRPP

OTHER CHANGES
    o Added a pairwise variance comparison for the pairwise function.

BUG FIXES 
    o Tuned F-stat calculations to allow for model-specific residual 
    variances, for multiple terms.
    o Updated procD.lm to better work with data in the gloabl 
    environment rather than a data frame. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN RRPP VERSION 0.3.0 (Minor release)

NEW FEATURES
    o Added print.summary.pairwise.
    o Added model.comparison function.
    o Added classify function.
OTHER CHANGES
    o Added an update to allow classify to work on univeraite data.
BUG FIXES 
    o Tuned criterion for assessing whether generalized inverse should be 
    performed.
    o Fixed bug with GLS variance estimation in pairwise.
    o Fixed some issues with univariate data for classify.
    o Fixed some issues with univariate data for pairwise.
    o Fixed the logL function within model.comparisons for GLS determinants 
    (was returning 0).
    o Fixed some issues with the aov.multimodel subfunction of anova.lm.rrpp, 
    related to GLS permutations and intercept only models.  
    o Added random SS output to aov.multimodel subfunction of anova.lm.rrpp, 
    so that it can be called by other functions/packages.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN RRPP VERSION 0.2.0 (Minor release)

NEW FEATURES
    o pairwise function: allows pairwise comparison of means or slopes for a 
    lm.rrpp fit.
    o A vignette for using RRPP, which is the same as Appendix S2 in Collyer and Adams 
    (2008). RRPP: An R package for fitting linear models to high-dimensional data using 
    residual randomization. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.  (submitted)

OTHER CHANGES
    o Added multi-model inference capabaility to anova.lm.rrpp
    
BUG FIXES 
    o Fixed issue for coef.lm.rrpp tests when type II or type III SS is chosen, 
    to make sure that appropriate coefficients are used.
