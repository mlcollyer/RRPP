Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michael Collyer, Dean Adams
Maintainer: Michael Collyer <mlcollyer@gmail.com>
Description: Linear model calculations made for many random versions of data.  Using residual randomization in a permutation procedure, sums of squares are calculated over many permutations to facilitate generating empirical probability distributions for evaluating model effects.
