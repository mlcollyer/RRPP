Title: Linear Model Evaluation with Randomized Residuals in a Permutation Procedure
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michael Collyer, Dean Adams
Maintainer: Michael Collyer <mlcollyer@gmail.com>
Description: Linear model calculations are made for many random versions of data.  
    Using residual randomization in a permutation procedure, sums of squares are 
    calculated over many permutations to generate empirical probability distributions 
    for evaluating model effects.  This method is described by 
    Collyer, Sekora, & Adams (2015) <doi:10.1038/hdy.2014.75>.
