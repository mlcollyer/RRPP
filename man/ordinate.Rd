\usage{
ordinate(
  Y,
  A = NULL,
  Cov = NULL,
  transform. = TRUE,
  scale. = FALSE,
  tol = NULL,
  rank. = NULL,
  newdata = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{An n x p data matrix.}

\item{A}{An optional n x n symmetric matrix or an n x k data 
matrix, where k is the number of variables that could
be associated with the p variables of Y.  If NULL, an n x n 
identity matrix will be used.}

\item{Cov}{An optional n x n covariance matrix to describe 
the non-independence among
observations in Y, and provide a GLS-centering of data.  
Note that Cov and A can be the same, if one
wishes to align GLS residuals to the same matrix used to 
obtain them.  Note also that no explicit GLS-centering
is performed on A.  If this is desired, A should be 
GLS-centered beforehand.}

\item{transform.}{An optional argument if a covariance matrix 
is provided to transform GLS-centered residuals, if TRUE.  If FALSE, 
only GLS-centering is performed.  Only if transform = TRUE 
(the default) can one expect the variances of ordinate scores 
in a principal component analysis to match eigenvalues.}

\item{scale.}{a logical value indicating whether the variables 
should be scaled to have unit variance before the analysis 
takes place. The default is FALSE.}

\item{tol}{A value indicating the magnitude below which 
components should be omitted. (Components are omitted if their 
standard deviations are less than or equal to tol times the 
standard deviation of the first component.) 
With the default null setting, no components are omitted 
(unless rank. is provided). 
Other settings for tol could be tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), 
which would omit essentially constant components, or tol = 0,
to retain all components, even if redundant.
This argument is exactly the same as in \code{\link{prcomp}}}

\item{rank.}{Optionally, a number specifying the maximal rank, 
i.e., maximal number of aligned components to be used. 
This argument can be set as alternative or in addition to tol, 
useful notably when the desired rank is considerably 
smaller than the dimensions of the matrix.  This argument is 
exactly the same as in \code{\link{prcomp}}}

\item{newdata}{An optional data frame of values for the same 
variables of Y to be projected onto 
aligned components.  This is only possible with OLS 
(transform. = FALSE).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ordinate} is a list containing 
the following
\item{x}{Aligned component scores for all observations}
\item{xn}{Optional projection of new data onto components.}
\item{d}{The portion of the squared singular values attributed to 
the aligned components.}
\item{sdev}{Standard deviations of d; i.e., the scale of the components.}
\item{rot}{The matrix of variable loadings, i.e. the singular 
vectors, \bold{V}.}
\item{center}{The OLS or GLS means vector used for centering.}
\item{transform}{Whether GLS transformation was used in projection 
of residuals 
(only possible in conjunction with GLS-centering).}
\item{scale}{The scaling used, or FALSE.}
\item{alignment}{Whether data were aligned to principal axes or 
the name of another matrix.}
\item{GLS}{A logical value to indicate if GLS-centering and 
projection was used.}
}
\description{
Function performs a singular value decomposition of ordinary 
least squares (OLS) or 
generalized least squares (GLS) residuals, aligned to an alternative 
matrix, plus projection of 
data onto vectors obtained.
}
\details{
The function performs a singular value decomposition, 
\bold{t(A)Z} = \bold{UDt(V)}, where
\bold{Z} is a matrix of residuals (obtained from \bold{Y}; 
see below) and \bold{A}
is an alignment matrix with the same number of rows as \bold{Z}.  
(\bold{t} indicates matrix transposition.)  \bold{U}  and \bold{V}
are the matrices of left and right singular vectors, and \bold{D} 
is a diagonal matrix of singular
values. \bold{V} are the vectors that describe maximized 
covariation between \bold{Y} and \bold{A}. 
If \bold{A} = \bold{I}, an n x n identity matrix, \bold{V} are the
eigen vectors (principal components) of \bold{Y}.

\bold{Z} represents a centered and potentially standardized 
form of \bold{Y}.  This
function can center data via OLS or GLS means (the latter if 
a covariance matrix to describe
the non-independence among observations is provided).  If 
standardizing variables is preferred,
then \bold{Z} both centers and scales the vectors of \bold{Y} 
by their standard deviations.  

Data are projected onto aligned vectors, \bold{ZV}.  If a 
GLS computation is made, the option to transform centered values 
(residuals) before projection is 
available.  This is required for orthogonal projection, but 
from a transformed data space.  Not transforming
residuals maintains the Euclidean distances among observations 
and the OLS multivariate variance, but
the projection is oblique (scores can be correlated).

The versatility of using an alignment approach is that 
alternative data space rotations are possible.
Principal components are thus the vectors that maximize 
variance with respect to the data, themselves,
but "components" of (co)variation can be described for any 
inter-matrix relationship, including
phylogenetic signal, ecological signal, ontogenetic signal, 
size allometry, etc.
More details are provided in Collyer and Adams (2021).

Much of this function is consistent with the \code{\link{prcomp}} 
function, except that centering data
is not an option (it is required).

SUMMARY STATISTICS: For principal component plots, the traditional 
statistics to summarize the analysis include
eigenvalues (variance by component), proportion of variance by 
component, and cumulative proportion of variance. 
When data are aligned to an alternative matrix, the statistics 
are less straightforward.  A summary of
of such an analysis (performed with \code{\link{summary.ordinate}}) 
will produce these additional statistics:

\describe{
\item{\bold{Singular Value}}{  Rather than eigenvalues, the 
singular values from singular value decomposition of the 
cross-product of the scaled alignment matrix and the data.}
\item{\bold{Proportion of Covariance}}{  Each component's 
singular value divided by the sum of singular values.  The cumulative
proportion is also returned.  Note that these values do not 
explain the amount of covariance between the alignment matrix 
and data, but
explain the distribution of the covariance.  Large proportions 
can be misleading.}
\item{\bold{RV by Component}}{  The partial RV statistic by 
component.  Cumulative values are also returned.  The sum of partial
RVs is Escoffier's RV statistic, which measures the amount of 
covariation between the alignment matrix and data.  Caution should
be used in interpreting these values, which can vary with the 
number of observations and number of variables.  However,
the RV is more reliable than proportion of singular value for 
interpretation of the strength of linear association for 
aligned components.  (It is most analogous to proportion of 
variance for principal components.)}
