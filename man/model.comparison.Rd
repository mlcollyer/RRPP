\title{Model Comparisons, in terms of the log-likelihood, covariance trace,
or Z-score.}
\usage{
model.comparison(
  ...,
  type = c("cov.trace", "logLik", "Z"),
  predictor = NULL,
  tol = NULL,
  pc.no = NULL,
  gls.null = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Any number of lm.rrpp class objects for model fits 
to be compared.}

\item{type}{An argument to choose between log-likelihood, 
covariance trace, or Z results.  If Z is chosen, Z-scores are calculated, the same log-likelihoods
are calculated as with the log-likelihood type, but also in every RRPP permutation,
as describe for the initial mode fits, with choice of null model (below).}

\item{predictor}{An optional vector that can be used to profile the results based on type
across a range of numerical values described by the predictor.  A spline will also be fit, which
will reveal estimated values of the predictor that yield maximum and minimum values of model
comparison metric.}

\item{tol}{If type = logLik or Z, tol is a tolerance value between 0 and 1, 
indicating the magnitude below which 
components should be omitted (if standard deviations of 
components are less than the eigenvalue of the first 
component times the tolerance), for calculating the log-likelihood.}

\item{pc.no}{If type = logLik or Z, an optional value to indicate the 
number of principal components (maximum rank) to use 
for calculating the log-likelihood.}

\item{gls.null}{A logical value indicating whether GLS estimation should be
used with the null (intercept) model, for calculating Z scores via RRPP of 
log-likelihoods.  This should be FALSE if comparing different GLS estimations
of covariance matrices.  It should be TRUE if comparing different model fits
with the same GLS-estimated covariance matrix.}

\value{
An object of class \code{model.comparison} is a data 
frame with either log-likelihoods
or covariance traces, plus parameter penalties.  AIC scores 
might be include, if applicable
}
\description{
Function calculates either log-likelihoods or traces of covariance 
matrices for comparison with 
respect to parameter penalties, or calculates Z-scores from RRPP, which
can be profiled across a gradient (predictor).
}
\details{
The function calculates either log-likelihoods or traces of (residual) 
covariance matrices, plus parameter 
penalties, to assist in comparative model evaluation or selection.  
Because high-dimensional data often
produce singular or ill-conditioned residual covariance matrices, 
this function does one of two things: 1) uses 
the trace of a covariance matrix rather than its determinant; or 2) 
provides a ridge-regularization (Warton, 2008)
of the covariance matrix, only if it is determined that it is 
ill-conditioned.  Regardless of implementation,
covariance matrices are projected into a principal component (PC) 
space of appropriate dimensions.

The parameter penalty is based on that proposed by Bedrick and Tsai 
(1994), equal to 2(pk + p(p + 1)/2), where 
p is the appropriate dimension (not number of variables) of the 
covariance matrix.  The parameter, k,
 is the rank of the model design matrix.
 
In the case that "logLik" is chosen for the argument, type, 
AIC scores are calculated.  These scores
may not perfectly match other packages or software that 
calculate AIC for multivariate data, if ridge regularization
was used (and if other packages require p = the number of 
data variables).  When choosing logLik as the type of comparison,
it might be a good idea to adjust the tolerance or number of data 
principal components.  The default (NULL) values will
use all data dimensions to calculate log-likelihoods, which 
might cause problems if the number of variables exceeds the number 
of observations (producing singular residual covariance matrices).  
However, one should not reduce data dimensions haphazardly,
as this can lead to poor estimates of log-likelihood.  Furthermore, 
using the tolerance argument could result in different
numbers of principal components used for each model to calculate 
log-likelihoods, which might be a concern for comparing models.  
If both tol and pc.no arguments are used, the solution will use 
the fewest PCs produced by either argument.  Because the trace
of a covariance matrix is not sensitive to matrix singularity, 
no PC adjustment is used for the cov.trace argument.

This function can also calculate Z-scores from RRPP on model log-likelihoods, 
which can be compared directly or profiled along a gradient (predictor).  
This might be useful for for comparing generalized least-squares (GLS) models, 
for example, along a gradient of a parameter used to scale the covariance 
matrix for GLS estimation. See Collyer et al. 2022 for an example of using
RRPP on log-likelihoods with different covariance matrices.

Users can construct their own tables 
from the results but this function does not attempt to 
summarize results, as interpreting results requires 
some arbitrary decisions.  The \code{\link{anova}} function 
explicitly tests multiple models and can be used for nested 
model comparisons.

Results can also be plotted using the generic \code{\link{plot}} 
function.

Caution: For models with GLS estimation, the number of 
parameters used to estimate the covariance matrix
is not taken into consideration.  A generalized information 
criterion is currently in development.
