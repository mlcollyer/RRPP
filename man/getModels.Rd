\title{Utility Function for RRPP}
\usage{
getModels(fit, attribute = c("terms", "X", "qr", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Object from \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}}

\item{attribute}{The various attributes that are used to extract RRPP
permutation schedules.  If there are n observations, each iteration has
some randomization of 1:n, restricted by the arguments that match attributes
provided by this function.}
}
\description{
A function mostly for internal processing but can be used to obtain terms,
design matrices, or QR decompositions used for each reduced or full
model that is fitted in an \code{\link{lm.rrpp}} fit.
