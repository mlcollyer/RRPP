\arguments{
\item{f1}{A formula for the linear model (e.g., y~x1+x2).  Can also 
be a linear model fit
from \code{\link{lm}}.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations for significance testing}

\item{turbo}{A logical value that if TRUE, suppresses coefficient estimation 
in every random permutation.  This will affect subsequent analyses that 
require random coefficients (see \code{\link{coef.lm.rrpp}})
but might be useful for large data sets for which only ANOVA is needed.}

\item{seed}{An optional argument for setting the seed for random 
permutations of the resampling procedure.
If left NULL (the default), the exact same P-values will be found 
for repeated runs of the analysis (with the same number of iterations).
If seed = "random", a random seed will be used, and P-values will vary.  
One can also specify an integer for specific seed values,
which might be of interest for advanced users.}

\item{int.first}{A logical value to indicate if interactions of first 
main effects should precede subsequent main effects}

\item{RRPP}{A logical value indicating whether residual randomization 
should be used for significance testing}

\item{data}{A data frame for the function environment, see 
\code{\link{rrpp.data.frame}}}

\item{Cov}{An optional argument for including a covariance matrix 
to address the non-independence
of error in the estimation of coefficients (via GLS).  If included, 
any weights are ignored.  This matrix must math in dimensions either
the number of subjects or the number of observations.}

\item{delta}{A within-subject scaling parameter for covariances, ranging from 
0 to 1.  If delta = 0, a sight value (0.001) is added to assure variances of the 
covariance matrix are 0.1 percent larger than covariances.}

\item{gamma}{A sample-size scaling parameter that is adjusted to be 1 ("equal")
scaling or the square-root of the sample size for subject observations ("sample").}

\item{print.progress}{A logical value to indicate whether a progress 
bar should be printed to the screen.
This is helpful for long-running analyses.}

\item{Parallel}{Either a logical value to indicate whether parallel processing 
should be used, a numeric value to indicate the number of cores to use, or a predefined
socket cluster.  This argument defines parallel processing via the \code{parallel} library. 
If TRUE, this argument invokes forking or socket cluster assignment of all processor cores, 
except one.  If FALSE, only one core is used. A numeric value directs the number of cores to 
use, but one core will always be spared.  If a predefined socket cluster (Windows) is provided,
the cluster information will be passed to \code{parallel}.}

\item{...}{Arguments typically used in \code{\link{lm}}, such as 
weights or offset, passed on to
\code{lm.rrpp} for estimation of coefficients.  If both weights and 
a covariance matrix are included,
weights are ignored (since inverses of weights are the diagonal elements 
of weight matrix, used in lieu
of a covariance matrix.)}

\value{
An object of class \code{lm.rrpp.ws} is a list containing the 
following
\item{call}{The matched call.}

\description{
Function performs a linear model fit over many random permutations of 
data, using a randomized residual permutation procedure restricted to
subjects.
}
\details{
The function fits a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS) or 
generalized least squares (GLS) estimation of coefficients over any 
number of random permutations of the data, but the permutations are mostly 
restricted to occur with subject blocks for any model terms other than subjects.  
All functionality should resemble that of \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}.  However, 
an argument for research subjects is also required.  The purpose of this function 
is to account for the non-independence among observations of research subjects 
(due to sampling within subjects), while also allowing for the non-independence 
among subjects to be considered.  

By comparison, the covariance matrix option in \code{\link{lm.rrpp}} must have a
one-to-one match to observations, which can be matched by the row names of the data.
In this function, the covariance matrix can be the same one used in \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}
but the number of observations can be greater.  For example, if subjects are
species or some other level of taxonomic organization, data can comprise measurements
on individuals.  User have the option to expand the covariance matrix for subjects
or input one they have generated.

Most attributes for this analysis are explained with \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}.  
The notable different attributes for this function are that: (1) a covariance 
matrix for the non-independence of subjects can be either a symmetric matrix 
that matches in dimensions the number of subjects or the number of observations; 
(2) a parameter (delta) that can range between near 0 and 1 to calibrate the 
covariances
between observations of different subjects; and (3) a parameter (gamma) 
that is either
1 (equal) or the square-root of the subject sample size (sample) to calibrate
the covariances among observations within subjects.  If delta = 0, covariances 
between
observations between different subjects are assumed to be the same as the 
covariances 
between subjects as if each subject had only one observation.  If delta = 1,
then observations are considered most independent, despite inter-subject 
covariance. 
However, the sample size (n_i) for subject i can influence the trend, as 
inter-subject
covariances are multiplied by exp(-delta * gamma), and gamma = sqrt(n_i) or 1.  
In essence, one can tune the expected covariances between observations by 
how variable
one expects the observations to be within subjects.


This option could be important for data with hierarchical organization.
For example, data sampled from multiple species with expected covariances 
among species based on phylogenetic distances, might be expected to not covary as
strongly if sampling encounters other strata like population, sex, and age.
An a priori expectation is that covariances among observations would be expected to
be smaller than between species, if only one observation per species were made.

If one wishes to have better control over between-subject and within-subject
covariances, based on either a model or empirical knowledge, a covariance matrix should 
be generated prior to analysis.  A function to generate such matrices based on separate
inter-subject and intra-subject coavriance matrices is forthcoming.

IMPORTANT.  It is assumed that either the levels of the covariance matrix (if 
subject by subject) match the subject levels in the subject argument, or that
the order of the covariance matrix (if observation by observation) matches the order
of the observations in the data.  
No attempt is made to reorder the a covariance matrix by observations
and row-names of data are not used to re-order the covariance matrix.  It is best to
not use data names but make sure the subjects variable is accurate with respect to the data.
If the covariance matrix is large (same in dimension as the number of observations), one has
to make sure that observations and covariances are ordered the same before analysis.  If the
covariance matrix is small (same in dimension as the number of subject levels), the function
will compile a large covariance matrix that is correct in terms of order.

More details will be made.

The \code{\link{lm.rrpp}} arguments not available for this function include: 
full.resid, block, and SS.type.  These arguments are fixed because of
the within-subject blocking for tests, plus the requirement for type II SS
for within-subject effects.
