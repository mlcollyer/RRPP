\title{K-component analysis}
\usage{
kcomp(Y, Cov, transform. = TRUE, scale. = FALSE, tol = NULL, rank. = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{An n x p data matrix.}

\item{Cov}{An required n x n covariance matrix to describe 
the non-independence among
observations in Y, and provide a GLS-centering of data.}

\item{transform.}{An optional argument to transform GLS-centered residuals, 
if TRUE.  If FALSE, only GLS-centering is performed.}

\item{scale.}{A logical value indicating whether the variables 
should be scaled to have unit variance before the analysis 
takes place. The default is FALSE.}

\item{tol}{A value indicating the magnitude below which 
components should be omitted. (Components are omitted if their 
standard deviations are less than or equal to tol times the 
standard deviation of the first component.)}

\item{rank.}{Optionally, a number specifying the maximal rank, 
i.e., maximal number of K components to be used. 
This argument can be set as alternative or in addition to tol, 
useful notably when the desired rank is considerably 
smaller than the dimensions of the matrix of the K matrix.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{kcomp} is a list containing 
the following
\item{values}{The eigenvalues of the K matrix,}
\item{vectors}{The eigenvectors of the K matrix.}
\item{scores}{The projected scores of data onto the eigenvectors.}
}
\description{
Function performs a K-comonent analysis, which is an eigen decomposition
of a ratio of ordinary least-squares (OLS) to generalized least squares (GLS)
covariance matrices.
}
\details{
The function performs a K-component analysis (KCA), as described in Mitteroecker et al. (2025).  
The analysis is similar to many that can be performed with  the \code{\link{ordinate}} function,
but whereas that function finds ordinate scores for a rotation or shear of a data space, KCA performs 
a relative eigen decomposition of a matrix product that represents a ratio between two covariance
matrices (Mitteroecker and Bookstein, 2014).  The eigenvalues are helpful for understanding the importance
of the GLS estimation of a covariance matrix.  For example, if the GLS estimation is made with
respect to a matrix of phylogenetic covariances, the eigenvalues express the distribution of 
phylogenetic signal across components of the data space.  

The matrix product (K matrix) is the inverse of the OLS covariance matrix times 
the GLS covariance matrix.  
Redundancies between these matrices will mean the K matrix is likely not full rank.  Therefore,
an algorithm is used to compute scores in appropriate dimensions.  First, data are aligned to the 
square-root matrix of the GLS
covariance matrix (Collyer and Adams, 2021), using the \code{\link{ordinate}} function.  Second, relative eigen decomposition is 
performed, and the number of real eigenvectors that can be computed are retained.  Lastly, the same number of 
aligned components are used for projection of data onto relative eigenvectors (the K components).
