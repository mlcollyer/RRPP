\title{Snake Head Size and Regional Variation}
\description{
A data set containing variables for snake head size, 
snout-to-vent-length, sex, and geographic information.
}
\details{
These data were collected from prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis viridis),
from several geographic locations in the upper Midwest of the United States (Smith and 
Collyer, 2008).  Variables include a spatial measure of head size (HS), 
snout-to-vent-length (SVL, cm), sex, and the site and region where 107
snakes were captured.  These 
data are suitable for demonstrating model selection  in the book,
Permutational Biometry (Collyer & Adams, 2025).
