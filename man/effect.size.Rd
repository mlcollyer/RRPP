\title{Obtain Effect-size from a vector of values}
\usage{
effect.size(x, center = TRUE, target = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector of data to use.}

\item{center}{Logical value for whether to center x.}

\item{target}{The value to target in the distribution.  (If null, the first value
in the vector is used.).  If the target exists outside the range of x,
very small or very large z-scores are possible.  Additionally, if the target
is excessively outside of the range of x, it could affect the Box-Cox transformation 
used to transform x.}
}
\description{
A function to find the effect size (Z-score) of a target,
from a vector of values presumably obtained in random permutations.
