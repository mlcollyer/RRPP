\description{
Computes ordinary or generalized least squares coefficients
over the permutations of an \code{\link{lm.rrpp}} model fit with predefined random permutations.
For each coefficient vector, the Euclidean distance is calculated as an estimate of
the amount of change in Y, the n x p matrix of dependent variables; larger distances mean more change 
in location in the data space associated with a one unit change in the model design, for the parameter
described.  Random coefficients are based on either RRPP or FRPP, as defined by the 
\code{\link{lm.rrpp}} model fit.  If RRPP is used, all distributions of coefficient vector distances are 
based on appropriate null models as defined by SS type.
