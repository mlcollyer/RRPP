\description{
Function performs a leave-one-out cross-validation estimate of ordination
scores, which is helpful for determining if apparent "group differences"
in ordination plots arise merely from data dimensionality.
}
\details{
The function uses the strategy of Thioulouse et al. (2021) to perform N
ordinations for N observations, in which each of the N observations are left
out of the estimation of linear model coefficients, but the vector of data for
the left-out observation is projected on the eigenvectors of the fitted values 
obtained from the leave-one-out cross-validation (jackknife) strategy.
The purpose of this diagnostic tool is to determine whether apparent "group differences"
in an ordination plot (using the function, \code{\link{ordinate}}) are
because of high-dimensional data (number of variables exceed number of observations)
rather than real differences.  An apparent group difference is common for high-dimensional
data, when variables are far greater in number than observations (Cardini et al., 2019).
However, leave-one-out cross-validation can help elucidate whether an observed visual 
difference is spurious.

This function differs from the strategy of Thioulouse et al. (2021) in two important 
ways.  First, this function uses the linear model design from a \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}
fit, and can contain any number of independent variables, rather than a single factor 
for groups.  Second, after obtaining leave-one-out cross-validated scores, a Procrustes
 alignment between cross-validated scores and "observed" (real) scores is performed, which 
minimizes summed squared distances between the alternative ordinations.  This latter
step assures comparisons are appropriate.

The type = "PC" plot from \code{\link{plot.lm.rrpp}} has the same scores as obtained
from ordinate(Y, A = H), using the \code{\link{ordinate}} function, where H is a hat
matrix (that can be calculated from \code{\link{plot.lm.rrpp}} output), and Y is a matrix 
of data.  This function updates H for every possible case that one row of Y is left out
(meaning the rotation matrix from \code{\link{ordinate}} is updated N times).  If
the H matrix is robust in spite of dropped data and design matrix parameters, the result
will be similar to the original ordination.  If apparent group differences are spurious,
H will tend to change, as will data projections.

The functions \code{\link{summary.looCV}} and \code{\link{plot.looCV}} are essential for 
evaluating results.  These support functions compare eigenvalues and 
projected scores, between observed and cross-validated cases.  

This function should be viewed as a diagnostic tool and not as a data transformation tool!
The cross-validated scores will not retain Euclidean distances among observations.  This
could cause problems in analyses that substitute cross-validated scores as data.

# Example with real group differences

data(Pupfish)
fit <- lm.rrpp(coords ~ Pop*Sex, data = Pupfish, iter = 0)
CV1 <- looCV(fit)
summary(CV1)
group <- interaction(Pupfish$Pop, Pupfish$Sex)
plot(CV1, flip = 1, pch = 19, col = group)

# Example with apparent but not real group differences

n <- NROW(Pupfish$coords)
p <- NCOL(Pupfish$coords)
set.seed(1001)
Yr <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p) # random noise

fit2 <-lm.rrpp(Yr ~ Pop*Sex, data = Pupfish, iter = 0)
CV2 <- looCV(fit2)
summary(CV2)
group <- interaction(Pupfish$Pop, Pupfish$Sex)
plot(CV2, pch = 19, col = group)
