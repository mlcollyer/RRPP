\title{Linear model evaluation with Randomized Residual Permutation Procedures}
\description{
Functions in this package allow one to evaluate linear models with residual randomization.
The name, "RRPP", is an acronym for, "Randomization of Residuals in a Permutation Procedure."  Through
the various functions in this package, one can use randomization of residuals to generate empirical probability
distributions for linear model effects, for high-dimensional data or distance matrices.
