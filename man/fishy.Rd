\description{
Simulated fish data for measurement error analysis
}
\details{
Data as simulated in Collyer and Adams (2024),
resembling a fish shape, comprising Procrustes coordinates
for 11 anatomical landmarks.  Data represent 120 
configurations for 60 subjects, each with two replicates of
measurement.  The 60 subjects represent 20 subjects each 
from three groups.
