#' Linear Model Evaluation with RRPP performed within subjects
#'
#' Function performs a linear model fit over many random permutations of 
#' data, using a randomized residual permutation procedure restricted to
#' subjects.
#'
#' The function fits a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS) or 
#' generalized least squares (GLS) estimation of coefficients over any 
#' number of random permutations of the data, but the permutations are mostly 
#' restricted to occur with subject blocks for any model terms other than subjects.  
#' All functionality should resemble that of \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}.  However, 
#' an argument for research subjects is also required.  The purpose of this function 
#' is to account for the non-independence among observations of research subjects 
#' (due to sampling within subjects), while also allowing for the non-independence 
#' among subjects to be considered.  
#' 
#' By comparison, the covariance matrix option in \code{\link{lm.rrpp}} must have a
#' one-to-one match to observations, which can be matched by the row names of the data.
#' In this function, the covariance matrix can be the same one used in \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}
#' but the number of observations can be greater.  For example, if subjects are
#' species or some other level of taxonomic organization, data can comprise measurements
#' on individuals.  User have the option to expand the covariance matrix for subjects
#' or input one they have generated.
#' 
#' Most attributes for this analysis are explained with \code{\link{lm.rrpp}}.  
#' The notable different attributes for this function are that: (1) a covariance 
#' matrix for the non-independence of subjects can be either a symmetric matrix 
#' that matches in dimensions the number of subjects or the number of observations; 
#' (2) a parameter (delta) that can range between near 0 and 1 to calibrate the 
#' covariances
#' between observations of different subjects; and (3) a parameter (gamma) 
#' that is either
#' 1 (equal) or the square-root of the subject sample size (sample) to calibrate
#' the covariances among observations within subjects.  If delta = 0, covariances 
#' between
#' observations between different subjects are assumed to be the same as the 
#' covariances 
#' between subjects as if each subject had only one observation.  If delta = 1,
#' then observations are considered most independent, despite inter-subject 
#' covariance. 
#' However, the sample size (n_i) for subject i can influence the trend, as 
#' inter-subject
#' covariances are multiplied by exp(-delta * gamma), and gamma = sqrt(n_i) or 1.  
#' In essence, one can tune the expected covariances between observations by 
#' how variable
#' one expects the observations to be within subjects.
#' 
#' 
#' This option could be important for data with hierarchical organization.
#' For example, data sampled from multiple species with expected covariances 
#' among species based on phylogenetic distances, might be expected to not covary as
#' strongly if sampling encounters other strata like population, sex, and age.
#' An a priori expectation is that covariances among observations would be expected to
#' be smaller than between species, if only one observation per species were made.
#' 
#' If one wishes to have better control over between-subject and within-subject
#' covariances, based on either a model or empirical knowledge, a covariance matrix should 
#' be generated prior to analysis.  A function to generate such matrices based on separate
#' inter-subject and intra-subject coavriance matrices is forthcoming.
#' 
#' IMPORTANT.  It is assumed that either the levels of the covariance matrix (if 
#' subject by subject) match the subject levels in the subject argument, or that
#' the order of the covariance matrix (if observation by observation) matches the order
#' of the observations in the data.  
#' No attempt is made to reorder the a covariance matrix by observations
#' and row-names of data are not used to re-order the covariance matrix.  It is best to
#' not use data names but make sure the subjects variable is accurate with respect to the data.
#' If the covariance matrix is large (same in dimension as the number of observations), one has
#' to make sure that observations and covariances are ordered the same before analysis.  If the
#' covariance matrix is small (same in dimension as the number of subject levels), the function
#' will compile a large covariance matrix that is correct in terms of order.
#' 
#' More details will be made.
#' 
#' The \code{\link{lm.rrpp}} arguments not available for this function include: 
#' full.resid, block, and SS.type.  These arguments are fixed because of
#' the within-subject blocking for tests, plus the requirement for type II SS
#' for within-subject effects.
#' 
#' 
#' @param f1 A formula for the linear model (e.g., y~x1+x2).  Can also 
#' be a linear model fit
#' from \code{\link{lm}}.
#' @param iter Number of iterations for significance testing
#' @param turbo A logical value that if TRUE, suppresses coefficient estimation 
#' in every random permutation.  This will affect subsequent analyses that 
#' require random coefficients (see \code{\link{coef.lm.rrpp}})
#' but might be useful for large data sets for which only ANOVA is needed.
#' @param seed An optional argument for setting the seed for random 
#' permutations of the resampling procedure.
#' If left NULL (the default), the exact same P-values will be found 
#' for repeated runs of the analysis (with the same number of iterations).
#' If seed = "random", a random seed will be used, and P-values will vary.  
#' One can also specify an integer for specific seed values,
#' which might be of interest for advanced users.
#' @param int.first A logical value to indicate if interactions of first 
#' main effects should precede subsequent main effects
#' @param RRPP A logical value indicating whether residual randomization 
#' should be used for significance testing
#' @param Cov An optional argument for including a covariance matrix 
#' to address the non-independence
#' of error in the estimation of coefficients (via GLS).  If included, 
#' any weights are ignored.  This matrix must math in dimensions either
#' the number of subjects or the number of observations.
#' @param delta A within-subject scaling parameter for covariances, ranging from 
#' 0 to 1.  If delta = 0, a sight value (0.001) is added to assure variances of the 
#' covariance matrix are 0.1 percent larger than covariances.
#' @param gamma A sample-size scaling parameter that is adjusted to be 1 ("equal")
#' scaling or the square-root of the sample size for subject observations ("sample").
#' @param data A data frame for the function environment, see 
#' \code{\link{rrpp.data.frame}}
#' @param print.progress A logical value to indicate whether a progress 
#' bar should be printed to the screen.
#' This is helpful for long-running analyses.
#' @param Parallel Either a logical value to indicate whether parallel processing 
#' should be used, a numeric value to indicate the number of cores to use, or a predefined
#' socket cluster.  This argument defines parallel processing via the \code{parallel} library. 
#' If TRUE, this argument invokes forking or socket cluster assignment of all processor cores, 
#' except one.  If FALSE, only one core is used. A numeric value directs the number of cores to 
#' use, but one core will always be spared.  If a predefined socket cluster (Windows) is provided,
#' the cluster information will be passed to \code{parallel}.
#' @param ... Arguments typically used in \code{\link{lm}}, such as 
#' weights or offset, passed on to
#' \code{lm.rrpp} for estimation of coefficients.  If both weights and 
#' a covariance matrix are included,
#' weights are ignored (since inverses of weights are the diagonal elements 
#' of weight matrix, used in lieu
#' of a covariance matrix.)
