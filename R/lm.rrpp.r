#' Linear Model Evaluation with a Randomized Residual Permutation Procedure
#'
#' Function performs a linear model fit over many random permutations of 
#' data, using a randomized residual permutation procedure.
#'
#' The function fits a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS) or 
#' generalized least squares (GLS) estimation of coefficients over any 
#' number of random permutations of the data.  A permutation procedure that 
#' randomizes vectors of residuals is employed.  This
#' procedure can randomize two types of residuals: residuals from null 
#' models or residuals from
#' an intercept model.  The latter is the same as randomizing full values, 
#' and is referred to as
#' as a full randomization permutation procedure (FRPP); the former uses 
#' the residuals from null
#' models, which are defined by the type of sums of squares and cross-products 
#' (SSCP) sought in an
#' analysis of variance (ANOVA), and is referred to as a randomized residual 
#' permutation procedure (RRPP).
#' Types I, II, and III SSCPs are supported.
#'
#' Users define the SSCP type, the permutation procedure type, whether a 
#' covariance matrix is included
#' (GLS estimation), and a few arguments related to computations.   
#' Results comprise observed linear model
#' results (coefficients, fitted values, residuals, etc.), random sums of 
#' squares (SS) across permutation iterations,
#' and other parameters for performing ANOVA and other hypothesis tests, 
#' using empirically-derived probability distributions.
#'
#' \code{lm.rrpp} emphasizes estimation of standard deviates of observed 
#' statistics as effect sizes
#' from distributions of random outcomes.  When performing ANOVA, using 
#' the \code{\link{anova}} function,
#' the effect type (statistic choice) can be varied.  See 
#' \code{\link{anova.lm.rrpp}} for more details.  Please
#' recognize that the type of SS must be chosen prior to running 
#' \code{lm.rrpp} and not when applying \code{\link{anova}}
#' to the \code{lm.rrpp} fit, as design matrices for the linear model 
#' must be created first.  Therefore, SS.type
#' is an argument for \code{lm.rrpp} and effect.type is an argument for 
#' \code{\link{anova.lm.rrpp}}.  If MANOVA
#' statistics are preferred, eigenvalues can be added with 
#' \code{\link{manova.update}} and statistics summarized with
#' \code{\link{summary.manova.lm.rrpp}}.  See \code{\link{manova.update}} 
#' for examples.
#' 
#' The \code{\link{coef.lm.rrpp}} function can be used to test the specific 
#' coefficients of an lm.rrpp fit.  The test
#' statistics are the distances (d), which are also standardized (Z-scores).  
#' The Z-scores might be easier to compare,
#' as the expected values for random distances can vary among coefficient 
#' vectors (Adams and Collyer 2016).
#' 
#'  \subsection{ANOVA vs. MANOVA}{ 
#'  Two SSCP matrices are calculated for each linear model effect, for 
#'  every random permutation: R (Residuals or Random effects) and
#'  H, the difference between SSCPs for "full" and "reduced" models. 
#'  (Full models contain and reduced models lack
#'  the effect tested; SSCPs are hypothesized to be the same under a 
#'  null hypothesis, if there is no effect.  The 
#'  difference, H, would have a trace of 0 if the null hypothesis were 
#'  true.)  In RRPP, ANOVA and MANOVA correspond to
#'  two different ways to calculate statistics from R and H matrices.
#'  
#'  ANOVA statistics are those that find the trace of R and H SSCP 
#'  matrices before calculating subsequent statistics,
#'  including sums of squares (SS), mean squares (MS), and F-values.  
#'  These statistics can be calculated with univariate data
#'  and provide univariate-like statistics for multivariate data.  
#'  These statistics are dispersion measures only (covariances
#'  among variables do not contribute) and are the same as "distance-based" 
#'  stats proposed by Goodall (1991) and Anderson (2001).
#'  MANOVA stats require multivariate data and are implicitly affected 
#'  by variable covariances.  For MANOVA, the inverse of R times
#'  H (invR.H) is first calculated for each effect, then eigenanalysis 
#'  is performed on these matrix products.  Multivariate
#'  statistics are calculated from the positive, real eigenvalues.  In 
#'  general, inferential
#'  conclusions will be similar with either approach, but effect sizes 
#'  might differ.
#'  
#'  ANOVA tables are generated by \code{\link{anova.lm.rrpp}} on lm.rrpp 
#'  fits and MANOVA tables are generated
#'  by \code{\link{summary.manova.lm.rrpp}}, after running manova.update 
#'  on lm.rrpp fits.
#'  
#'  Currently, mixed model effects are only possible with $ANOVA statistics, 
#'  not $MANOVA.
#'  
#'  More detail is found in the vignette, ANOVA versus MANOVA.

#'
#'  \subsection{Notes for RRPP 0.5.0 and subsequent versions}{ 
#'  The output from lm.rrpp has changed, compared to previous versions.  
#'  First, the $LM
#'  component of output no longer includes both OLS and GLS statistics, 
#'  when GLS fits are 
#'  performed.  Only GLS statistics (coefficients, residuals, fitted values) 
#'  are provided 
#'  and noted with a "gls." tag.  GLS statistics can include those calculated
#'  when weights are input (similar to the \code{\link[stats]{lm}} argument).  
#'  Unlike previous 
#'  versions, GLS and weighted LS statistics are not labeled differently, 
#'  as weighted
#'  LS is one form of generalized LS estimation.  Second, a new object, 
#'  $Models, is included
#'  in output, which contains the linear model fits (\code{\link[stats]{lm}} 
#'  attributes ) for
#'  all reduced and full models that are possible to estimate fits.
#'  
#' }
#' 
#'  \subsection{Notes for RRPP 0.3.1 and subsequent versions}{ 
#'  F-values via RRPP are calculated with residual SS (RSS) found uniquely 
#'  for any model terms, as per
#'  Anderson and ter Braak (2003).  This method uses the random pseudo-data 
#'  generated by each term's
#'  null (reduced) model, meaning RSS can vary across terms.  Previous 
#'  versions used an intercept-only 
#'  model for generating random pseudo-data.  This generally has appropriate 
#'  type I error rates but can have
#'  elevated type I error rates if the observed RSS is small relative 
#'  to total SS.  Allowing term by term
#'  unique RSS alleviates this concern.
#' }
#'
#' @param f1 A formula for the linear model (e.g., y~x1+x2).  Can also 
#' be a linear model fit
#' from \code{\link{lm}}.
#' @param iter Number of iterations for significance testing
#' @param turbo A logical value that if TRUE, suppresses coefficient estimation 
#' in every random permutation.  This will affect subsequent analyses that 
#' require random coefficients (see \code{\link{coef.lm.rrpp}})
#' but might be useful for large data sets for which only ANOVA is needed.
#' @param seed An optional argument for setting the seed for random 
#' permutations of the resampling procedure.
#' If left NULL (the default), the exact same P-values will be found 
#' for repeated runs of the analysis (with the same number of iterations).
#' If seed = "random", a random seed will be used, and P-values will vary.  
#' One can also specify an integer for specific seed values,
#' which might be of interest for advanced users.
#' @param int.first A logical value to indicate if interactions of first 
#' main effects should precede subsequent main effects
#' @param RRPP A logical value indicating whether residual randomization 
#' should be used for significance testing
#' @param SS.type A choice between type I (sequential), type II 
#' (hierarchical), or type III (marginal)
#' sums of squares and cross-products computations.
#' @param Cov An optional argument for including a covariance matrix 
#' to address the non-independence
#' of error in the estimation of coefficients (via GLS).  If included, 
#' any weights are ignored.
#' @param data A data frame for the function environment, see 
#' \code{\link{rrpp.data.frame}}
#' @param print.progress A logical value to indicate whether a progress 
#' bar should be printed to the screen.
#' This is helpful for long-running analyses.
#' @param Parallel Either a logical value to indicate whether parallel processing 
#' should be used, a numeric value to indicate the number of cores to use, or a predefined
#' socket cluster.  This argument defines parallel processing via the \code{parallel} library. 
#' If TRUE, this argument invokes forking or socket cluster assignment of all processor cores, 
#' except one.  If FALSE, only one core is used. A numeric value directs the number of cores to 
#' use, but one core will always be spared.  If a predefined socket cluster (Windows) is provided,
#' the cluster information will be passed to \code{parallel}.
#' @param ... Arguments typically used in \code{\link{lm}}, such as 
#' weights or offset, passed on to
#' \code{rrpp.fit} for estimation of coefficients.  If both weights and 
#' a covariance matrix are included,
#' weights are ignored (since inverses of weights are the diagonal elements 
#' of weight matrix, used in lieu
#' of a covariance matrix.)
