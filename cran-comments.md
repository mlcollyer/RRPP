## Resubmission
This is a patch release, version 0.6.1, that fixes a few bugs in version 0.6.0 (which was a minor release).   The package, `geomorph`, is developed by the same authors as `RRPP`.  The reverse dependency has been addressed during development of this patch release.  All other dependencies should be unaffected, functionally, as no attribute or functional changes have been introduced.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (all platforms)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
