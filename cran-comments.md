## Resubmission

This is a patch release, 2.1.2, which merely fixes a bug with
`print.summary.betaTest`, that caused failure to print some results.  
The package, `geomorph`, is developed by the same 
authors as `RRPP`.  The reverse dependency has been addressed during 
development of this release and any necessary changes would be 
concomitantly submitted. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (all platforms)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
