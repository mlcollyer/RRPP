## Resubmission
This is a minor release, 1.1.0, that includes two new functions: `looCV` and `na.omit.rrpp.data.frame`.

The package, `geomorph`, is developed by the same authors as `RRPP`.  The reverse dependency has been addressed during development of this release.  All other dependencies should be unaffected, functionally, as no attribute or functional changes have been introduced.

`RRPP 1.1.0` and `geomorph 4.0.1` are to be concurrently updated and released.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.1
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (all platforms)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
