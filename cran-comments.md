## Resubmission

This is a patch release, 2.1.1, which adds the function, 
`print.summary.betaTest` and updates `summary.betaTest` to not automatically
print to the screen, plus fixes a small bug.  The package, `geomorph`, is developed by the same 
authors as `RRPP`.  The reverse dependency has been addressed during 
development of this release and any necessary changes would be 
concomitantly submitted.
