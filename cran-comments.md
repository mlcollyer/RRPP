## Resubmission
This is a minor release, version 0.6.0, that fixes a few bugs in version 0.5.2, and adds one function.This will have no effect on dependencies, as the new function has no dependencies.

The package, `geomorph`, is developed by the same authors as `RRPP`.  The reverse dependency has been addressed with simultaneous package updates.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (all platforms)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
